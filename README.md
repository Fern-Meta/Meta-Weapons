# Meta-Weapons
Hello! This is my first ever actual datapack project. In this datapack, I just create a lot of weapons that do custom things.

# List of Weapons

## Infuser

The Infuser is the first weapon that I ever made. It was named after the Infuse SMP (Before it had abilities). What this sword does is it gives you a random positive potion effect whenever you attack something. The potion effect strength is two and the length is ten

## Defuser

This weapon is supposed to be the opposite of the infuser, even though those two words have completely different definitions. This sword gives enemy players a random negative potion effect whenever they are hit by this sword. I left out a couple of effects like levitiation (For obvious reasons) and blindness because it disables sprint and crits

## Wind Burst Sword

This one is gonna get removed because I didn't know that you could put wind burst on a sword normally, but it just makes a wind burst happen at your feet when you crouch and hit something

## Dual Deagle

These are just two guns that shoot when right click. They have 30 bullets each, and each shot deals 15 damage. When its 30 bullet magazine is emptied (Always quicker than you'd think), it needs to reload for a couple seconds. I made a texture pack for this which makes it look like two desert eagles, but I have just now realized that the resource pack (At least now) is private... I'm gonna temporarily turn the text into an AR-15 because that makes WAY more sense (Given the ammo size and speed), but having it based on any real gun is against Minecraft's eula, so I will figure out something original later.

## Teleporter

This sword fires a beam that teleports the user to where it lands. Currently, if multiple people have the sword, the datapack will literally just take a guess as to who fired it (Meaning a random person who has the sword will get teleported). I'll fix it later because some people really like this

## Spectral Dash

This one just looks cool, but will probably have to remove it though :(
When you right click it, you get turned to spectator, dash straight forward and emerge out. It goes through walls and that is the difference between this and the teleporter. 
It looks cool, but I will have to remove it because if the player holds down 1 on the keyboard, it will teleport them to the first player online alphabetically. To my knowledge, only way to fix it is by installing a plugin that removes teleporting in spectator

## Demonic Mace

This is a mace that when right clicked, will launch you in the air and slam you on the ground. Everyone around you will catch on fire

## King's Crown

This is the first item released on the Defects SMP. When worn, it will give you an extra row of hearts and when you crouch, it will summon four maxed out wither skeletons that will not attack you.

## Yamato

I'm currently going through a phase where I'm really into Devil May Cry right now, so I decided to make a sword from the game! The Yamato will perform an AOE attack that slashes the air and after a few seconds will deal 50 damage to everyone caught in it's radius. Based off of Vergil's Judgement Cut

## Devil Trigger

This item (Also ripped from Devil May Cry) is charged by getting a kill. Once you activate it, one charge will be taken off you. While in your 'Devil Trigger' state, you will get a full set of maxed netherite armour, strength 2, and speed 2 for a minute. You may also notice the DMC inspired style meter on your screen. If you get a combo, it goes up by one for each hit, but if you get hit during the combo, the meter goes all the way back down. Once you reach the S ranks, you gain speed 3 and strength 3 for 30 seconds.
